# Appium Android Testing Project

This repository contains a simple Android testing project using Appium, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG. The project is set up to run automated UI tests on an Android application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**
- **Maven**
- **Appium Server**
- **Android SDK**

## Project Structure

- **`AppTest.java`**: The main test class that initializes the Appium driver, opens the Android application, and performs basic UI testing.
- **`pom.xml`**: The Maven configuration file containing the dependencies and build configurations for the project.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Configure your device and app**:
    - Ensure that an Android device or emulator is running and connected.
    - Modify the `DesiredCapabilities` in `AppTest.java` to match your device and application details:

[//]: # (      ```java)

[//]: # (      cap.setCapability&#40;"deviceName", "YourDeviceName"&#41;;)

[//]: # (      cap.setCapability&#40;"platformVersion", "YourAndroidVersion"&#41;;)

[//]: # (      cap.setCapability&#40;"app", "path/to/your/app.apk"&#41;;)

[//]: # (      ```)

4. **Start the Appium server**:
   Ensure the Appium server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub`.

## Running the Tests

To execute the test, run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This command will start the Android application on the connected device/emulator and run the UI tests defined in the `AppTest.java` file.

## Maven Profiles

The `pom.xml` includes several profiles for different test configurations:

- **`android-single`**: Runs tests on a single Android device.
- **`android-parallel`**: Runs tests in parallel on multiple Android devices.
- **`ios-single`**: Runs tests on a single iOS device (if iOS support is added).
- **`ios-parallel`**: Runs tests in parallel on multiple iOS devices (if iOS support is added).

To run tests using a specific profile, use the following command:

```bash
mvn test -Pandroid-single
```

Replace `android-single` with the desired profile ID.

## Troubleshooting

- **Appium Server Issues**: Ensure that the Appium server is running and accessible.
- **Device Connection Issues**: Verify that the device is connected and recognized by ADB (`adb devices`).
